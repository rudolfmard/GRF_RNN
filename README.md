Python script related to my batchelor's thesis: Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Prediction of Ground Reaction Forces During Walking (2020)
Author: Rudolf MÃ¥rd

The objective of the thesis was to train a simple recurrent neural network model to make predictions of a three dimensional ground reaction force during walking. The model was trained on a time series data containing joint angles of a walking person.

This was my first, slightly bigger, project I have conducted on my own with a little help from my thesis advisor.
